# 4M-Mehni-s-Misc-Modifications

Adds various settings to customise your RimWorld experience.

Current features include:

- Bugfixes for vanilla issues

Cats in vanilla can't hunt due to a bug. Can you believe that?!
The game gives up on sending you manhunter packs once you reach a certain size. No more!

- Extend the time for pawns to undraft themselves

Stay where I put you!
Ever had colonists auto undraft themselves while positioning them? Not anymore.

- Change the threshold at which pawns retreat

Raiders flee at 50% by default. That's boring. Let's randomise the flee threshold.
Want a bigger challenge? Turn off fleeing entirely. Want a laid back game? Set it lower!

- Extend the time before you get kicked out of caravan maps

Because sometimes you need more time. Changing this setting requires a restart.

Everything in the mod is optional. All settings can be configured or turned off. More options are planned, but leave me a comment with your ideas. I prioritise by popular and easy-to-do ;-)
